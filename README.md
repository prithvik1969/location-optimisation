We present a fast, flexible heuristic for setting up warehouse locations for quick commerce businesses, with the goal of serving the largest number of customers under the constraints of delivery radius and maximum daily deliveries per warehouse. Quick commerce or direct-to-customer delivery businesses guarantee delivery within a specified time. Using experiments on various scenarios, we show that the proposed algorithm is flexible enough to handle variations such as non-uniform population distributions, variable travel times, and selection of multiple warehouse locations.
